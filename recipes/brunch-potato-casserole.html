    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was given to me, and I continue to pass it down to everyone who tries it! Aside from being so delicious, it's so versatile that I've even used it as a side dish for steak! This can be made the night before, then baked the next day -- allow 10 extra minutes of cooking time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds new potatoes,skinned,cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 pound processed cheese food, cubed</li>
        <li>2 cups mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 onion,finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound bacon, cooked crisp and chopped </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pan, fill with water to cover potatoes, and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are just soft. Drain, place in a large bowl. While the potatoes are still hot, gently stir in cheese without mashing potatoes. Continue to stir, every minute or so, until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, onion, and bacon. Gently stir into potatoes and cheese. Spread into a 13x9-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
        <p><strong>Done!</strong></p>
